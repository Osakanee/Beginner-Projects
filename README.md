<h1> Beginner projects (Python) </h1>
All of the projects only for showing what I'm learning and using python for, most of these will use rich and progress for styles
<br>
These projects can be used as ideas for other people, which is why i'm leaving it in this repo.
<br>
Any projects of the programming language shown on my profile will be in a separate repo
<br><br>
Requirements - pip:
<pre>
  pip install rich
  pip install progress
</pre>
